# Structure of mapping rules in the conversion layer 1
#
# How to use: Load this file as a dictionary to convert raw data sets into the
# standard version towards the iTEM3 template.
#
# Dictionary 1:
#    Raw_columns_mapping is used to convert the raw data set's columns into the
#    standard one and specify the missing columns:
#       ["Model", "Scenario", "Region", "Variable", "Unit", "Mode",
#        "Technology", "Fuel", "Year", "Value"]
# Dictionary 2:
#   add is used to add the missing columns with assigned
#   values based on the data set's content
# Dictionary 3:
#   replace is used to convert raw columns values to the
#   template ones, e.g., Electrical energy->Electricity
#   replace contains basic mapping rules only to keep most
#   the raw data set's taxonomy
# Dictionary 4:
#   note is used to describe the raw data set to provide more information for
#   further processing

      Variables collected are inland transport of goods (T-km), of passengers
      (P-km) and road injury accidents. Additional information is also gathered
      on containers transported by rail and sea (Tons and TEU) as well as short
      sea shipping data (T-km).
