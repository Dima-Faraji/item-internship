# Measures for transport data
#
# Each measure is a concept (see concepts.yaml), i.e. has id, name, and
# description.
#
# Measures also have units, specified in one of two ways:
# 1. As a string. All observations of this measure will have this unit.
# 2. As a collection of "[dimension] == [value]: [unit]" lines. [unit] will be
#    used when an observation's key for [dimension] is equal to [value].
