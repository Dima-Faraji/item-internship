# Specification of the iTEM MIP3 data template
#
# Each specification has:
# - measure: see measures.yaml. A measure may be repeated in multiple specs.
# - dims: zero or more dimensions. All specifications implicitly have the
#         dimensions Model, Scenario, Region, and Year.
# - exclude: Pandas query() syntax for keys to exclude from the specification/
#            template. More than one may be given. See http://pandas.pydata.org/
#            pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.query.html
